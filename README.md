Week 3 Python Challenge

----------------
|    PyBank    |
----------------

PyBank analyses a csv file of dates and profit/loss.

The results analyzed are:
    1. Total number of months included in the data file
    2. Net total of profit/loss over the time period
    3. Changes in profit/loss over the time period
    4. Average change of profit/loss over the time period
    5. Greatest increase in profit (and associated date)
    6. Greatest decrease in profit (and associated date)

Python knowledge gained:
    - importing os and csv Modules into Python
    - reading a csv file into Python and opening it
    - checking the rows in the csv file
        - counting the number of rows (total number of months)
        - calculating the sum of information in the rows (net total profit/loss)
        - calculating and totalling the difference between the rows (change in profit/loss)
        - creating and using variables to store information while iterating through rows
        - comparing and capturing the greatest increase and decrease white iterating through rows
        - printing results to the terminal
        - creating a text file to capture the results
        - opening and writing to a text file
        - printing to a text file, including adding new line returns for readability


----------------
|    PyPoll    |
----------------

PyPoll analyses a csv file of ballot ids, counties, and candidates.

The results analyzed are:
    1. Total number of votes in the data file
    2. Creating a list of the candidates who received votes
    3. The percentage of votes for each candidate
    4. The number of votes for each candidate
    5. The winner of the election based on the votes

Python knowledge gained:
    - importing os and csv Modules into Python
    - reading a csv file into Python and opening it
    - checking the rows in the csv file
        - counting the number of rows (total vote count)
        - creating a list of unique values from a large list (candidate list)
        - conditionally counting the number of rows (individual candidate vote counts)
        - calculating a percentage from a count and total within a list (indivitual candidate percentage of votes)
        - identifying the highest number in a list (determining the winner from the candidate vote counts)
        - printing results to the terminal
        - creating a text file to capture the results
        - opening and writing to a text file
        - printing to a text file, including adding new line returns for readability
